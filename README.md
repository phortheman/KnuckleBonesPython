 The dice game Knuckle Bones from The Cult of Lamb written in python played on the terminal

# Improvements
- Refactor so that the lanes on a board are stored in a list so iterating through them is easier
- Improve terminal draw logic to be more efficient
- Separate classes from the "__main__" file
- Implement pytest to test functions
- Make a better AI that will choose either the lane that gives them a higher score or reduces the players score the most
- Make a UI
